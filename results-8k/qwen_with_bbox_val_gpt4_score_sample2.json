Noise affects similar regions and adds graininess, especially around the moose and trees. Out of focus blur impacts several parts, including the moose's head and areas to the left, top, and right of the moose.These distortions overlap significantly, resulting in compounded effects. The low clarity makes the moose and background details hard to distinguish. Noise adds to the difficulty by making the image appear grainy. The out of focus blur exacerbates the problem by rendering parts of the image indistinct.Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

Compression artifacts are present throughout most of the image, significantly degrading the clarity of the dancers and the background. Low clarity affects the entire image, making it difficult to discern fine details in their outfits and faces. The combination of these distortions overlapping almost completely creates a heavily pixelated and blurry visual that obscures important elements. These severe distortions distort the image to the extent that it becomes challenging for viewers to appreciate the dance poses or the setting. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

Compression artifacts are present throughout the image, significantly lowering the visual clarity, especially noticeable in the central battle scene and minimap, where details are essential for gameplay. Low clarity affects the entire image, compounding the degradation caused by the compression artifacts, making the scene and text difficult to discern. These issues are particularly detrimental to the gameplay experience, where clarity and detail are crucial. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

Compression artifacts are present across almost the entire image, particularly degrading the clarity of characters and abilities in the central and bottom right areas. Low clarity affects the top and upper central sections, making details in the game's text and fine elements difficult to discern. The severity of the compression artifacts significantly impacts the overall image quality by introducing blockiness and blurriness around key gameplay areas. The low clarity further diminishes the visibility of critical elements, such as in game text and ability descriptions. These combined distortions create a visually unappealing and potentially distracting experience for players. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

There is an out of focus blur affecting the lower central region, diminishing the clarity of the horizon. A ringing effect is noticeable around the branch, particularly visible against the bright sky, creating unnatural edges. Aliasing occurs in the upper central portion, impacting the smoothness of the branch's outline. These distortions collectively degrade the visual quality, particularly in how they disrupt the natural lines and color transitions which are crucial for the aesthetic appeal of such a serene scene. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

Compression artifacts affect almost the entire image, leading to a loss of detail and clarity in the depiction of the fish and water. Low clarity is present throughout, blurring the vibrant colors and textures of the fish. Additionally, interlaced scanning affects the central and right portions of the image, creating visible line artifacts that further degrade visual quality, particularly noticeable on the moving fish. These distortions collectively diminish the image's sharpness and color fidelity, making the scene less appealing and harder to view clearly. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

        "answer_gt": "The image shows two coiled metal springs being heated by a blue flame, possibly from a blowtorch. Aliasing is present in the central area around the heated metal springs and considerably affects their clarity. Low clarity spans most of the image, with particularly significant blurriness on the upper parts and near the bottom. Noise is mainly at the bottom edge, adding graininess to the overall appearance. Meaningless solid color occupies the upper left corner, another area near the center left, obscuring actual details of the springs and flame.Among these, low clarity and aliasing are particularly severe, blurring the springs and reducing the sharpness of the flame, while the noise and solid colors add unnecessary visual distraction.Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",
        "answer_pred": "The image shows a close up of a gas burner with its flame burning a metallic object. Excessive darkness is present in the top left, bottom left, and top center regions, obscuring parts of the flame and metallic object. Low clarity affects the central and lower left regions, making the details of the objects and flames appear blurry. The excessive darkness significantly reduces visibility in key areas, while low clarity makes the overall image appear unfocused. The combined effects of these distortions severely degrade the viewer's ability to discern fine details, reducing the overall visual appeal and effectiveness of the image. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",

Low clarity is prevalent across most of the image, leading to a lack of sharpness and definition, severely impacting the overall visibility of the train and the station. Aliasing is particularly evident around the train's edges, causing visible jagged lines that distort its shape and details.Overall, the overexposure, low clarity, and aliasing severely degrade the image, resulting in an overall poor quality and significantly impacting its visual appeal and effectiveness.Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",
        "answer_pred": "The image features a close up of a black locomotive on railway tracks, surrounded by a station setting.Aliasing distortions are prominent near the locomotive's side, particularly affecting the wheels and parts of the frame, making these areas appear jagged and pixelated. Additionally, aliasing is seen near the bottom of the image, impacting the clarity of the tracks and gravel below.The entire image suffers from low clarity, causing the overall scene to appear blurry and reducing the sharpness of the locomotive and surrounding elements. This distortion is most severe at the top of the image, where the station structure and overhead structures are indistinctly blurred.The severity of low clarity is compounded by its extensive coverage, leading to a generally hazy appearance. Aliasing further degrades the quality by creating noticeable artifacts in critical areas. The combined effects significantly diminish the viewer's ability to appreciate the fine details of the locomotive and its surroundings.Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",
