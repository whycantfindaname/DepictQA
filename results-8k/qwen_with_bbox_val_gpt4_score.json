        "answer_gt": "The image displays five jet aircraft flying in formation against a clear blue sky, releasing trails of white smoke. Low clarity affects the central region and extends to the borders, causing the details of the aircraft and smoke trails to appear blurry and indistinct. Aliasing is present in multiple localized areas, primarily around the aircraft and smoke trails, introducing jagged edges and disrupting the smooth appearance of these elements. Low clarity is the most severe distortion, significantly reducing the sharpness and overall visibility of the image. Aliasing, while covering smaller areas, exacerbates the degradation by adding noticeable artifacts around key features. The combination of these distortions results in a generally unappealing and difficult to interpret image. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",
        "answer_pred": "The image depicts a flight show where several jets are leaving contrails in a clear blue sky. Low clarity is present in two regions, one spanning almost the entire left side and a smaller area around the middle. These distortions blur the details of the jets and their contrails in these areas. Aliasing is noticeable in the center region where four jets are lined up, creating jagged edges on the jets and contrails. The combination of low clarity and aliasing significantly diminishes the visual appeal, with aliasing being particularly disruptive as it disrupts the clean lines of the jets and their smoke trails. Thus, the quality of the image is poor.",
